<br>
<br>The Forkhead Box P2 (FOXP2) transcription factor is the first gene discovered to be specifically involved in the development of speech and language. Recent studies in birds, mice and fruit flies have shown that the gene exerts this involvement via its conserved function in a particular form of operant conditioning: operant self-learning. In operant self-learning, the subject learns about the outcomes of its own behavior and modifies the behavior accordingly. The neurobiology underlying this recently described form of learning is largely unknown, only Protein Kinase C and the FoxP gene family have been identified across taxa to be critically involved. The mechanism underlying operant self-learning has also been shown not to underlie other forms of learning, such as operant world-learning, allowing for a very rigorous behavioral analysis of the specificity of any of our neurobiological manipulations. In order to understand the mechanism by which FoxP mediates the neuronal modifications underlying operant self-learning, we need to find out which neurons express FoxP and which FoxP-dependent cellular processes underly memory formation. To this end, we will generate transgenic fly lines with which we will manipulate not only the expression of FoxP generally, but also the activity of FoxP expressing neurons. We will also generate monoclonal antibodies against the FoxP protein not only to study endogenous FoxP expression patterns, but also to validate and characterize our manipulations of FoxP expression. Behavioral experiments will then provide the information about which manipulation of FoxP expression in which neurons (or the activation/inactivation of which neurons) had a specific effect on operant self-learning (without affecting operant world-learning). The results of this research in the fruit fly will provide us with mechanistic insights into a novel form of behavioral learning (operant self-learning) which is one of the essential neurobiological underpinnings of speech and language acquisition in humans. As this form of learning is associated not only with speech and language disorders, but also with psychiatric disorders such as substance abuse, Tourette's or compulsive disorders, as well as with dyspraxias more broadly, the basic science on operant self-learning is instructive for clinical research in these areas as well. In fact, one instance of operant self-learning is already being researched as a treatment option for stroke patients, with the aim to increase their mobility.

Recent studies in birds, mice and the fruit fly *Drosophila* corroborate the early hypothesis that the gene exerts this involvement via its conserved function in a particular form of operant conditioning: motor learning (or operant self-learning) [@10.1371/journal.pbio.0050321 @10.1371/journal.pone.0100648 @10.1073/pnas.1414542111]. This conserved function allows for a mechanistic investigation using invertebrate genetic model organisms such as *Drosophila*. Studies of these forms of learning in other model organisms such as transgenic mice, songbirds and the marine snail *Aplysia* suffer from experimental difficulties (few genetic tools in birds and snails, difficult physiology and complex brains in vertebrates), which can be complemented by the fly model system. The *Drosophila* FoxP orthologue, dFoxP, expresses three isoforms, isoA, isoB and an intron-retention isoform (isoIR; [Figure](#dFoxPlocus)). The data suggest that isoB, in particular, may be specifically important for operant self-learning [@10.1371/journal.pone.0100648]. Therefore, we will focus our efforts on this isoform, but will include the other two isoforms, wherever possible.

In operant conditioning experiments, at least two simultaneous components can be discerned: learning about causal relations in the environment (world-learning) and learning about the outcomes of one's own behavior (self-learning) [@10.1371/journal.pone.0100648 @10.1016/j.beproc.2011.02.005 @10.4161/cib.3.2.10334 @10.1016/j.cub.2009.06.014 @10.1016/j.cub.2008.07.041]. For instance, a rat pressing a lever for food can learn that when the lever is pressed (whatever the actual movement to press the lever), food will drop into the hopper, and/or the rat can learn that it needs to perform a series of movements to obtain food.
<br>
<br>World-learning is mediated by the same, evolutionary conserved biochemical processes underlying synaptic plasticity, whether it is brought about by operant or by classical conditioning [@10.1016/j.cub.2008.07.041]. In world-learning, the sites of plasticity are commonly found along the sensory pathway (e.g., [@10.1101/lm.65303 @10.1126/science.7455692 @10.1101/lm.5.1.146 @10.1016/0304-3940(95)11309-K @10.1037/a0033979 @10.1523/JNEUROSCI.3286-12.2012 @10.3109/01677068509100140 @10.1016/j.neuron.2015.11.003]). Conversely, sites of plasticity have been identified along the motor control pathways in self-learning experiments, such as the cerebellum [@10.1126/science.1207403], the basal ganglia [@10.1073/pnas.1414542111 @10.1371/journal.pbio.0050321], central pattern generators [@Nargeot1999 @10.1126/science.1069434 @10.1016/j.neuron.2008.07.019 @10.1016/j.cub.2014.03.004 @10.1016/j.cub.2009.05.030] or motor neurons [@Wolpaw1994 @Wolpaw1995]. Unlike in world-learning, however, only two components of the biochemical pathways mediating neuronal change have been identified as evolutionary conserved in studies in humans [@10.1038/35097076] mice [@10.1126/science.1207403 @10.1073/pnas.1414542111], songbirds [@10.1111/j.1460-9568.2006.04763.x @10.1371/journal.pbio.0050321], snails [@10.1016/j.neuron.2008.07.019] and flies [@10.1016/j.cub.2008.07.041 @10.1371/journal.pone.0100648]: Protein Kinase C (PKC) and the transcription factor family FoxP.
<br>
<br>There are two main areas of research required for a mechanistic understanding of self-learning. Which biochemical processes need to take place in which neural circuits for operant self-learning to occur? In the fruit fly *Drosophila*, both areas can be studied and this proposal addresses specific aspects of both questions.
<br>
<br>The Forkhead Box P2 (FOXP2) transcription factor is the first gene discovered to be involved in the development of speech and language [@10.1038/35097076 @10.1038/nature01025]. Recent studies in birds, mice and the fruit fly *Drosophila* have corroborated the early hypothesis that the gene exerts this involvement via its conserved function in operant self-learning [@10.1371/journal.pbio.0050321 @10.1371/journal.pone.0100648 @10.1073/pnas.1414542111]. This conserved function allows for a mechanistic investigation using invertebrate genetic model organisms such as *Drosophila*. Studies of these forms of learning in other model organisms such as transgenic mice, songbirds and the marine snail *Aplysia* suffer from experimental difficulties (few genetic tools in birds and snails, difficult physiology and complex brains in vertebrates), which can be complemented by the fly model system. The *Drosophila* FoxP orthologue, dFoxP, expresses three isoforms, isoA, isoB and an intron-retention isoform (isoIR; [Figure {n}](#dFoxPlocus)). The data suggest that isoB, in particular, may be specifically important for operant self-learning [@10.1371/journal.pone.0100648]. Therefore, we will focus our efforts on this isoform, but will include the other two isoforms, wherever possible.

Given the data from other forms of self-learning, such as operant conditioning of the H-reflex (see, e.g., [@10.3389/fnint.2014.00025 @10.1146/annurev.neuro.24.1.807 @10.1016/S0166-2236(97)01133-8]), one would expect multiple sites of plasticity in operant self learning. In particular, work in vertebrate self-learning paradigms have implicated both cerebellar and basal ganglia structures. In fact, FOXP2 work in birds, mice and humans has focused almost exclusively on the basal ganglia. Hence, in order to elucidate FoxP function in operant self-learning, we need to find out if FoxP activity is required in the brain or in the ventral nerve chord of *Drosophila* for operant self-learning. However, as will be detailed below, we neither know the expression pattern of FoxP, nor do we have sufficient evidence that the available transgenic lines designed to specifically alter FoxP expression, affect FoxP.

It is a technical hurdle that the currently available FoxP mutant lines are insertion lines, which only affect the expression level of some of the isoforms. This makes it difficult, for instance, to evaluate the specificity of antibodies against FoxP. Despite the efforts of several laboratories around the world, including ours, there are now only polyclonal antibodies for dFoxP available (one published, see below, several unpublished), none of which satisfy basic specificity criteria. For example, in a collaboration with the laboratory of Prof. Dr. Schade at the Charit√©, Berlin, with decades of experience in generating highly specific polyclonal chicken sera (see publication at 1.1.2), we used four different peptides from the *Drosophila* FoxP gene and immunized chicken. Even after 10 months of immunization and subsequent affinity purification, the serum still detects several bands in a Western blot and none at the expected size ([Figure](#ImmunizationStrategy)). Subsequent efforts in the laboratory of Constance Scharff were successful in generating antibodies against honeybee FoxP, but a parallel and analogous attempt failed for *Drosophila* (pers. comm.). Other laboratories working on FoxP also struggle with antibody-generation (e.g., Annette Schenk, Gero Miesenb√∂ck, pers. comm.) and the only published report of wholemount immunofluorescence in the adult brain shows little overlap with the authors‚Äô own FoxP-GAL4 line and lacks documentation of standard validation procedures [@10.1016/j.bbr.2014.04.009], rendering the reliability of the expression reported from this antibody sub-optimal. Hence, in order to reliably detect the FoxP protein in wild type, mutant and transgenic *Drosophila*, monoclonal antibodies (ideally against all three isoforms) are required.

Because of these mismatches, without highly specific antibodies it is impossible to determine if the available lines mimic the FoxP mutant phenotype because of off-target effects or because of their effect on FoxP translation. Moreover, at least in vertebrates, FoxP2 appears to be an exceedingly stable protein, such that genomic manipulation of the locus needs weeks to have an effect on the protein level [@French2015]. Thus, a reliable antibody is required to assess the effectiveness of any manipulation targeting FoxP expression. Even with a specific antibody available, it would be desirable to have at least one RNAi line that reliably knocks down FoxP mRNA for experiments where immunotechniques are not feasible and as a positive control when testing the already available lines for knock down on the protein level.

The three available FoxP-GAL4 driver lines have been generated using, approx., 1, 1.5 and 2kb fragments of the dFoxP promotor region, respectively. All three lines differ widely in their expression pattern: The first published record of a FoxP-GAL4 expression pattern is from Lawton et al. [@10.1016/j.bbr.2014.04.009]. The authors describe their expression pattern with ‚ÄúParticularly strong expression was evident in the protocerebral bridge‚Äù, while the second published report on such a fly line described their expression pattern thusly: ‚ÄúFoxP-GAL4‚Äìdriven transgene expression was confined to two subsets of Kenyon cells (KCs), the principal intrinsic neurons of the mushroom bodies‚Äù [@10.1126/science.1252114].

The only way to determine which, if any, of the three FoxP-GAL4 lines mimics most closely the actual FoxP expression pattern, is to use highly specific, validated and thoroughly characterized antibodies for comparison and double-labelling. However, such experiments may also reveal that none of the expression patterns is accurate, as the existence of expression-altering P-Element insertions downstream of the FoxP gene suggest regulatory regions outside of the putative promotor region. These considerations are supported by FlyBase data indicating hotspots for jumu, sens, twi, Med, Ubx, D and dl downstream of the last FoxP exon (which one intuitively would have attributed to the downstream gene, hyd, if the insertions had had an effect on hyd expression, which they do not [@10.1371/journal.pone.0100648]). Moreover, there are multiple binding sites for known transcription factors (dl, twi, sens, inv), and different chromatin domains scattered throughout the FoxP gene region (FlyBase). Finally, in humans, an enhancer was recently discovered in the region downstream of the FOXP2 coding region [@10.1186/s13039-015-0173-0]. All of these consideration make it appear highly likely that a substantial amount of FoxP gene regulation is carried by regulatory elements within and downstream of the coding region of the gene, in which case the promotor-fragment method cannot yield reliable GAL4 lines. Specific and sensitive antibodies are required to test any transgenic lines as to their faithful reproduction of the wildtype dFoxP expression pattern.

Crucial for the study of self-learning is the experimental separation of the two components. In brief, operant self-learning experiments differ from composite experiments (i.e., where both world- and self-learning might occur) in the absence of a predictive external stimulus. As such, a composite experiment provides all the general motor and sensory controls as well as a control for general learning ability, while the self-learning procedure isolates the self-learning component from all other abilities shared by both tasks. This is accomplished by allowing stationary flying flies to use their yaw torque to control a punishing heat beam. In self-learning, no other stimuli are present during the experiment, forcing the fly to rely solely on its own behavior for predicting the occurrence of the heat. In the composite situation, an additional color stimulus is made contingent on the heat (and hence the yaw torque), allowing the fly to rely on both its own behavior and the color to predict the heat. In the latter situation, flies preferentially rely on and learn the color cue, rather than their own behavior. Hence, in the initial phases of this composite situation, operant world-learning appears to occur exclusively. Only with extended training is the self-learning component thought to start being engaged (i.e., habit formation starts; [@10.1371/journal.pone.0100648 @10.1016/j.beproc.2011.02.005 @10.4161/cib.3.2.10334 @10.1016/j.cub.2009.06.014 @10.1016/j.cub.2008.07.041]).

<br>However, given that all the techniques we will use are established and have been used successfully in many other instances in the collaborating laboratories, there is currently no reason to expect such a failure. In fact, I anticipate objectives 1 and 3 to yield more possible manipulations than can be behaviorally characterized within the funding period and objective 2 to produce more than just one antibody.

In order to characterize the neuronal structure and identity of FoxP isoB neurons, we will tag the last exon with a conditional CD8-GFP construct. Without expression of CD8-GFP, development of the fly will be wild type. When CD8-GFP expression is triggered after normal development, the construct will tether the protein to the membrane, not only labelling the entire neuron, but also preventing FoxP from entering the nucleus. The expression pattern of GFP (also in combination with immunochemistry for the FoxP protein) in these flies will reveal how successful this approach was. If the tether works, in addition to reporting the isoB neuronal identity and structure, this modification is predicted to also constitute an isoB-specific conditional mutant. We will test this prediction by subjecting these flies to behavioral experiments in operant self-learning. If, however, isoB forms di- or oligomers with other isoforms, we would expect a phenotype which is not specific to isoform B alone, e.g., the flies might show a flight deficit, as the mutant lines with compromised isoIR expression [@10.1371/journal.pone.0100648]. If there is no phenotype, the function of isoB appears to be cytosolic. If the GFP tag does not tether isoB to the membrane, we will replace exon 8 with the CD8-GFP construct either with a splice site or a basal promotor to generate an isoB specific mutant and membrane-bound reporter. Of course, different time-courses of CD8-GFP expression may thus also result in different phenotypes.

                    <td class="sub-line diff-context" style="width: 45%;">The generation of the CD8-GFP tagged flies will first be attempted with a relatively simple RMCE-based approach [@10.1534/g3.114.014803], where the MiMIC cassette ([Figure](#GenomicEditing)a) is replaced with a cassette containing a portion of the genomic region of the dFoxP locus downstream of the Mi{MIC} insertion, with a conditional CD8-GFP construct inserted immediately after the last exon (in-frame). The resulting strain will have an altered dFoxP locus in that an attR site is now contained within exon five and that a conditional CD8-GFP construct is inserted in-frame at the very end of exon 8 ([Figure](#GenomicEditing)b). Moreover, the right flanking region of the MiMIC cassette will now be pushed downstream by our insertion. As the attR site in exon 5 lies outside of the forkhead box and any potential regulatory regions downstream of the gene are contained in the genomic region we will insert, this manipulation should not alter dFoxP expression or function. However, as the Mi{MIC} insertion in line FBti0154903 is contained within a coding exon which is spliced into all FoxP isoforms, it is likely that this insertion alone already leads to a null mutation at the FoxP locus. Thus, we expect our RMCE approach to rescue any FoxP mutant phenotype the MiMIC strain might have. As the Hugo Bellen lab is currently generating a new series of MiMIC lines replacing those where the cassette failed to insert into an intron, it is possible that there will be such a new line available at the start of the project. We will test gene expression by Western blot as well as wholemount immunochemistry using the antibody developed in 2.3.1.2. We will test gene function using conditioning essays testing for operant self-learning as well as analyzing brain morphology. In the unlikely case that any of these tests reveal a deviation from wild type in the edited flies, we will manipulate the dFoxP genomic region using a more sophisticated approach. In this approach, again taking advantage of the available strain with the Mi{MIC} transposon inserted into the fifth exon of the dFoxP gene, we will use the fast and efficient gene knock-in technique described by Vilain et al. (2014) to additionally excise all unwanted flanking regions using double-strand-break-mediated homologous recombination triggered by transgenically expressed restriction enzymes. Should both approaches fail, we can fall back on the slightly more complicated method developed by [@10.1534/g3.114.013979] in nearby Munich to replace a suitable region of the FoxP locus with an insertion where the conditional CD8-GFP is attached to exon 8. In fact, by the time this project will commence, there will likely be a genome editing method published, which is even more effective and efficient than the ones cited above. In this case, we will of course use that method.

This hypothesis will be tested by screening all available RNAi lines targeting dFoxP, as well as a selection of RNAi lines targeting other, unrelated genes (e.g. rutabaga) for defects in operant self-learning [@10.1371/journal.pone.0100648 @10.4161/cib.3.2.10334 @10.1016/j.cub.2008.07.041 @10.1016/j.cub.2009.06.014]. The student will also test RNAi lines against the other known required protein class, the six Protein Kinase C (PKC) genes in *Drosophila*, as our results with these genes so far have been inconclusive (see attached manuscript). This comparison of RNAi lines will not only familiarize the student with this sort of experiments, but also yield insights into which RNAi lines show a self-learning phenotype and hence warrant further scrutiny. Once available, the RNAi line generated in this project will of course also be thoroughly characterized using this approach. For instance, in addition to pan-neuronal drivers, we will use the drivers identified by Julien Colomb in the PKC project (see attached manuscript) to investigate if the same neurons require both PKC and FoxP function for operant self-learning. With ever more specific driver lines, we will narrow down the minimal set of neurons where FoxP activity is required. All of the lines with a self-learning phenotype will also be tested for their phenotype when their expression is restricted to adulthood.
